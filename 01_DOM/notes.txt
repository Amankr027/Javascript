innerText

Definition: Represents the "rendered" text content of a node and its descendants.

Behavior:
1.Only includes the text that is visible to the user, excluding hidden elements.
2.Triggers a reflow and repaint of the document, which can be costly in terms of performance.
3.Takes CSS styles (like display: none or visibility: hidden) into account.

Example:

<div id="example">Hello <span style="display:none;">World</span></div>
<script>
    var text = document.getElementById("example").innerText;
    console.log(text); // Output: "Hello"
</script>

textContent
Definition: Represents the text content of a node and its descendants.

Behavior:

1.Includes all text, even if it's hidden with CSS styles.
2.Does not trigger reflow and repaint, making it more performant.
3.Does not parse HTML tags; it simply returns or sets the text as is.
Example:

<div id="example">Hello <span style="display:none;">World</span></div>
<script>
    var text = document.getElementById("example").textContent;
    console.log(text); // Output: "Hello World"
</script>

innerHTML

Definition: Represents the HTML content of an element as a string.

Behavior:

1.Includes HTML tags and allows setting or getting the entire HTML structure within an element.
2.Can be used to inject HTML, including elements and attributes.
3.Using innerHTML can potentially open up security risks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) if the content includes user-provided data.
Example:

<div id="example">Hello <span>World</span></div>
<script>
    var html = document.getElementById("example").innerHTML;
    console.log(html); // Output: "Hello <span>World</span>"
    
    // Setting innerHTML
    document.getElementById("example").innerHTML = "<p>New Content</p>";
    // The div now contains a paragraph with "New Content"
</script>


Summary
innerText: Reads or writes only the visible text of an element, taking CSS styles into account. Causes reflow and repaint.
textContent: Reads or writes all text content of an element, including hidden text. Does not cause reflow and repaint.
innerHTML: Reads or writes the HTML content of an element, including tags. Can include or insert HTML structure, but needs to be used carefully to avoid security issues.
